# credit-risk-classification
 
# Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to identify the credit-worthiness of borrowers.

# Details 
I used information from people's borrowing history, loan size, interest rate, income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, and derrogatory marks to predict wether the were marked healthy or high risk, using a Logistic Regression Model.

I then provided a report on the analysis and made a recommendation on the further use of the model.
